# WaldenSTT
WaldenSTT is a graphical interface for [absadiki's pywhispercpp](https://github.com/absadiki/pywhispercpp/), a speech to text tool
which itself is built on  [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)

WaldenSTT was created by JT for the folks at CiTR to make it easier to autogenerate text transcriptions of their radio shows.

#### A Note on licensing: 
WaldenSTT is built on Abdeladim Sadiki's python bindings for WhisperCPP. I wanted to make sure people using my code had access to these license details so I have included them all in one file. For any use of this code, you should refer to the previous licenses. My own (very minimal) intervention is simply an accessibility layer. It is a scholarly/pedagogical tool meant to improve access and encourage use of these tools.
